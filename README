HelloWorld
==========

This project started as a way to check twitter if it had been blocked at work. After that it became a sandbox to test new technologies and learn Ruby.
Probably its not correctly implemented and somehow poorly coded, but it does the job. 

It consists of two projects:

 - world.cache
 - world.hello
 
The Cache project provides a simple mechanism to download the profile pictures so they can also be seen externally.
The Hello project provides the main twitter engine.

There exists some areas of improvement, among these are:

 - Use localstorage to cache user or even posts information
 - Create sort of interfases or external provider service. 
 - Move all code to coffee
 - Better UI
 - Move twitter keys to env vars

Installation
============

Easy to install, its dotcloud ready.

 2. cd HelloWorld
 3. dotcloud create World
 4. dotcloud push World .
 5. dotcloud ssh World
 6. rake db:create && rake db:migrate
 7. edit twitter initializer with own keys.
